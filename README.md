# Observer Patch Holography (OPH)

> Observer Patch Holography starts from one claim: no observer sees the whole world at once. Each observer accesses only a local patch, and neighboring patches must agree on their overlap. OPH asks how much physics can be reconstructed from that starting point once the full axiom and branch ledger is made explicit.

**French version:** [README_FR.md](README_FR.md)

**Quick links:** [website](https://floatingpragma.io/oph/) | [OPH Textbooks](https://learn.floatingpragma.io/) | [OPH Lab](https://oph-lab.floatingpragma.io)

OPH is a reconstruction program for fundamental physics. Spacetime, gauge structure, particles, records, and observer synchronization are treated as consequences of the OPH package rooted in overlap consistency on a finite holographic screen, together with the explicit branch premises stated in the papers.

## What OPH Delivers

OPH is unusual because it tries to recover the shape of the world before it fits the numbers. At the structural level, it predicts the exact shape of the universe we appear to inhabit: a `3+1D` Lorentzian spacetime, de Sitter static-patch cosmology on the gravity side, and the Standard Model quotient `SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) / Z_6` with the exact hypercharge lattice and the counting chain `N_g = 3`, `N_c = 3`.

The quantitative side is deliberately small. OPH uses only two calibrated inputs: the screen-pixel scale `P = a_cell / l_P^2` and the total screen capacity `N_scr = log dim H_tot`, inferred from the cosmological constant. From that two-constant surface, OPH makes concrete numerical predictions for couplings, masses, and gravity-facing quantities instead of fitting each sector independently.

- A finite-resolution theorem package for observer patches, collars, overlap repair, higher gauge structure, records, and checkpoint/restoration.
- A conditional route to Lorentzian geometry, modular time, Jacobson-type Einstein dynamics, and de Sitter static-patch cosmology on the extracted prime geometric subnet; the Einstein branch uses fixed-cap stationarity, the null-surface bridge, and the separate bounded-interval projective branch, while the remaining UV/BW scaffold is geometric cap-pair realization on that subnet plus ordered cut-pair rigidity, with the eventual fixed-local-collar modular-transport common floor as the smallest lower blocker.
- A conditional compact gauge route in the bosonic branch to the realized Standard Model quotient `SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) / Z_6`, under the transportable-sector reconstruction premises and MAR, together with the exact hypercharge lattice and the realized counting chain `N_g = 3`, `N_c = 3`.
- A particle program with exact structural massless carriers, a forward-emitted Phase II electroweak calibration branch with a closed target-free public `W/Z` theorem surface plus a compare-only exact frozen pair, a quantitative Higgs/top stage, an exact selected-class quark closure with explicit exact forward Yukawas, exact non-hadron mass surfaces, and explicit continuation lanes where theorem boundaries remain open.
- A concrete screen-microphysics architecture that puts measurement, records, and observers inside the physics.

### Precise Derivations

This table focuses on OPH outputs with a clean one-number comparison against the latest official
PDG or NIST reference values. Structural results such as the `3+1D` Lorentz branch, the Standard
Model gauge quotient `SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) / Z_6`, the exact hypercharge lattice, and the counting
chain `N_g = 3`, `N_c = 3` are stated in the papers and are not repeated here.

Agreement is reported as a sigma distance where PDG or NIST quotes a one-standard-deviation
uncertainty. For exact definitions, exact digit matches, or published upper bounds, the table reports
`100% match` or `Below PDG bound` instead.

For the quark rows, PDG uses its standard quark-mass conventions: `u`, `d`, and `s` at `2 GeV`,
`c` and `b` in the `MS` scheme at their own mass scale, and the direct top-mass summary for `t`.
The papers also contain the structural Standard Model derivations listed above and a theorem-grade
neutrino family, which are not included in this table because they do not have a single direct
PDG/NIST one-number comparison row.

## Local Unification Surface

OPH places a local unification surface around the calibrated local UV input. The same `P`-driven scale carries the electroweak boson and Higgs lane together with the gravity-side entropy lane, while the Lorentz branch supplies the invariant causal speed and the local readout package supplies the SI display.
On the public constants surface, `hbar` and `k_B` remain part of that downstream familiar-unit readout rather than standalone OPH-emitted constants.
